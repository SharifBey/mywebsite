            We are students from Central Asia who came to Taiwan in age of 18 seeking high quality education.
          After living here (in Taiwan) for several years, we have experienced a lot of different things, such as
          meeting friends from different cultures. It is a unique experience where you can learn a lot. By sharing your own 
          experience in English you can improve your language profieciency and by listening you can learn about different 
          cultures and how they live.
